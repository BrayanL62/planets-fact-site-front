# FrontEndMenteorChallenge - Planets Fact Site 🤍

## NEXT JS 🤓

I chose to use Next JS because this isn't my predilection language and I needed to develop my skill with this one.

## TAILWIND 😁

I chose to use Tailwind to configure my CSS because I wanted discover an other CSS framework than Bootstrap or Figma and I start from zero with this one. I just discovered the beast so, my code will surely been more optimised in the futur.

## STRAPI 🥲

Since I'm more comfortable with front-end to back-end, but I wanted develop this website as a Full-Stack application, I chose to use Strapi because he offered me a simple way to develop an API for my application.

#### I tried my best and I'm proud to deliver a full stack app although it's not pixel perfect - Thanks 🙏🏼
